      </span>
      <v-divider class="my-2" />
      <p class="ma-6">
        The Module Page Filter Search function in MatHotSanayan introduces a
        versatile and efficient way for administrators to pinpoint specific
        modules based on various criteria. This feature empowers users to
        streamline their workflow by searching for modules according to three
        key parameters: module name, subject name, or keywords within the
        module's description.
      </p>

      <v-img class="ma-6" cover :src="require('@/assets/help/doc_004.png')" />

      <p class="ma-6">
        With the search by module name option, administrators can quickly locate
        a particular module by typing its name directly into the search bar.
        This targeted approach ensures swift access to specific assessments,
        saving valuable time and enhancing overall navigation.
      </p>

      <p class="ma-6">
        Similarly, the search by subject name allows for the effortless
        categorization of modules. Administrators can filter modules based on
        their designated subject, facilitating a systematic organization that
        aligns with the educational institution's curriculum structure.
      </p>

      <p class="ma-6">
        Moreover, the search by words within the module's description adds a
        layer of granularity to the search process. This functionality allows
        administrators to locate modules based on specific keywords present in
        their descriptions, providing a more nuanced and tailored approach to
        information retrieval.

      <p class="ma-6">
        Effortlessly initiate the creation of new assessment modules within
        MatHotSanayan by accessing the dedicated "Create Module" section. This
        intuitive process facilitates a seamless experience for administrators
        tasked with building robust assessments. Upon entering this section,
        administrators encounter a user-friendly interface featuring fields such
        as the module name, module step, passing grade, module description,
        module objective, and module instructions.
      </p>

      <v-img class="ma-6" cover :src="require('@/assets/help/doc_003.png')" />

      <p class="ma-6">
        Begin the module creation process by specifying the module name, acting
        as the distinct title for the assessment. This field allows
        administrators to provide a clear and identifiable name, enhancing
        organization and clarity within the MatHotSanayan system.
      </p>

      <p class="ma-6">
        As administrators enter module details, the module step field stands out
        as a unique and impactful element. This feature functions as a
        stage-setting tool, determining the accessibility of the module for
        students. If set to step 1, the module becomes immediately accessible to
        students. However, by adjusting the module step to 2 or higher,
        administrators can establish a sequential progression, allowing students
        to access the module only when they reach the designated stage.
      </p>

      <p class="ma-6">
        Utilizing the passing grade slider, administrators have the flexibility
        to set the passing grade for the exam on a scale ranging from 10% to
        100%. This dynamic feature tailors assessments to meet the precise
        grading standards of the institution, offering adaptability in line with
        educational goals.
      </p>

      <p class="ma-6">
        Furthermore, administrators can furnish additional information about the
        module through the module description, module objective, and module
        instruction fields. These details provide a comprehensive overview of
        the module's purpose, objectives, and specific instructions for both
        administrators and exam-takers.

      <p class="ma-6">
        Effortlessly refine and update existing assessment modules within
        MatHotSanayan through the intuitive "Update" option. This streamlined
        process provides administrators with a user-friendly interface to make
        necessary adjustments to module details. By accessing this option,
        administrators can easily modify parameters such as the module name,
        subject, passing grade, and other essential details. Once the
        modifications are made, simply save the changes, ensuring that the
        module information remains up-to-date, accurate, and reflective of the
        institution's evolving requirements. This seamless updating process
        enhances the adaptability of assessment modules, allowing educational
        institutions to maintain relevance and precision in their evaluation
        strategies.

      <p class="ma-6">
        Furthermore, the Modules Manager Page in MatHotSanayan introduces a
        dynamic activation feature that empowers administrators to enable or
        disable modules based on specific scheduling needs. This functionality
        offers strategic control over the availability of assessments within the
        system. By toggling the activation status of modules, administrators can
        precisely manage the timing of assessments, ensuring that they align
        with the academic calendar and institutional requirements. This flexible
        approach enables administrators to orchestrate the assessment
        environment with precision, enhancing overall control and efficiency in
        the administration of exams.

        Efficiently declutter your assessment system by removing redundant
        modules with a straightforward deletion process within MatHotSanayan.
        This user-friendly functionality streamlines the task of module
        management, ensuring a seamless experience for administrators. To
        initiate the deletion process, administrators can simply select the
        module they wish to remove. Once the target module is chosen, a
        confirmation prompt ensures intentional actions, minimizing the risk of
        accidental deletions. Confirm the action, and with a click, effortlessly
        eliminate the selected module, promoting a system cleanup that aligns
        with the evolving needs of your educational institution.

      <v-img class="ma-6" cover :src="require('@/assets/help/doc_006.png')" />

      <p class="ma-6">
        It's important to note that the deletion function is designed with a
        failsafe mechanism â€” a module can only be deleted if it has no questions
        attached to it. This built-in safeguard ensures the integrity of your
        assessment data and prevents unintentional data loss. This intentional
        design choice prioritizes data accuracy and helps administrators
        maintain a well-organized and error-free assessment environment. By
        incorporating this precaution, MatHotSanayan ensures a secure and
        controlled deletion process, reinforcing the commitment to precision and
        reliability in module management.
