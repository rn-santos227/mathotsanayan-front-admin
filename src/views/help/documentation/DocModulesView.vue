        process provides administrators with a user-friendly interface to make
        necessary adjustments to module details. By accessing this option,
        administrators can easily modify parameters such as the module name,
        subject, passing grade, and other essential details. Once the
        modifications are made, simply save the changes, ensuring that the
        module information remains up-to-date, accurate, and reflective of the
        institution's evolving requirements. This seamless updating process
        enhances the adaptability of assessment modules, allowing educational
        institutions to maintain relevance and precision in their evaluation
        strategies.

      <v-img class="ma-6" cover :src="require('@/assets/help/doc_005.png')" />

      <p class="ma-6">
        Furthermore, the Modules Manager Page in MatHotSanayan introduces a
        dynamic activation feature that empowers administrators to enable or
        disable modules based on specific scheduling needs. This functionality
        offers strategic control over the availability of assessments within the
        system. By toggling the activation status of modules, administrators can
        precisely manage the timing of assessments, ensuring that they align
        with the academic calendar and institutional requirements. This flexible
        approach enables administrators to orchestrate the assessment
        environment with precision, enhancing overall control and efficiency in
        the administration of exams.

        Efficiently declutter your assessment system by removing redundant
        modules with a straightforward deletion process within MatHotSanayan.
        This user-friendly functionality streamlines the task of module
        management, ensuring a seamless experience for administrators. To
        initiate the deletion process, administrators can simply select the
        module they wish to remove. Once the target module is chosen, a
        confirmation prompt ensures intentional actions, minimizing the risk of
        accidental deletions. Confirm the action, and with a click, effortlessly
        eliminate the selected module, promoting a system cleanup that aligns
        with the evolving needs of your educational institution.

      <p class="ma-6">
        It's important to note that the deletion function is designed with a
        failsafe mechanism â€” a module can only be deleted if it has no questions
        attached to it. This built-in safeguard ensures the integrity of your
        assessment data and prevents unintentional data loss. This intentional
        design choice prioritizes data accuracy and helps administrators
        maintain a well-organized and error-free assessment environment. By
        incorporating this precaution, MatHotSanayan ensures a secure and
        controlled deletion process, reinforcing the commitment to precision and
        reliability in module management.

      <v-img class="ma-6" cover :src="require('@/assets/help/doc_007.png')" />

      <p class="ma-6">
        One key aspect of the Question Management Page is the detailed breakdown
        of columns, each providing essential information about the questions.
        The "Image" column allows administrators to incorporate visuals
        associated with questions, adding a multimedia dimension to assessment
        content. The "Question" column presents the textual content of each
        question, ensuring clarity and precision in conveying assessment
        prompts. The "Question Type" column categorizes questions based on their
        format, aiding administrators in distinguishing between various question
        types, such as word problems, multiple selection questions, or
        single-correct answer questions. Additionally, the "Correct Answers and
        Solutions" column provides critical information about the number of
        correct answers and corresponding solutions, empowering administrators
        to evaluate question complexity effectively. Finally, the "Number of
        Available Options" column signifies the total count of answer choices,
        contributing to a comprehensive understanding of question structure.

      <p class="ma-6">
        Furthermore, the "Create Questions" section supports the efficient
        addition of multiple questions, each with distinct complexities.
        Administrators have the flexibility to create questions with multiple
        correct answers and multiple options, catering to the diverse nature of
        assessments. The "Word Questions" type permits the creation of questions
        where administrators can specify multiple correct answers, yet no
        solution is provided, allowing students to input their responses. The
        "Multiple Selection" type empowers administrators to add questions with
        multiple correct answers and multiple options, offering a comprehensive
        approach to capturing nuanced understanding. Meanwhile, the "Single
        Correct" type enables administrators to craft questions with multiple
        options but only one correct answer, streamlining the process of
        generating various question formats to suit the educational
        institution's assessment goals.
