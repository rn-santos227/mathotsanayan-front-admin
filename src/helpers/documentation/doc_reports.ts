  `In MatHOTSanayan's Examination Results Page, administrators can easily
  manage and analyze student's exam scores. This gives them a deep
  understanding of how students are doing. They can view detailed exam
  results like scores, remarks, and how long students took to answer each
  module.`,

  `Moreover, the Examination Results Page has action buttons that let the
  administrators see more information about the exam results and
  invalidate them if needed. The "Details" button shows administrators
  extra details like how many times a question was attempted and how many
  questions were skipped. On the other hand, the "Invalidate" button lets
  administrators invalidate exam results if there is a reason to do so.`,

  `The Examination Results Page's search functionality helps administrators
  quickly find results using different criteria, making it easy to get the
  information they need. They can search by module title, student name,
  course, school, section, or subject. Just by typing in keywords or
  details, administrators can find exactly what they are looking for,
  saving time and making their work more efficient.`,

  `This flexible feature lets administrators customize their searches to
  fit their needs, making it easier to find and organize information in
  the Examination Results Page. Whether they are looking for results for a
  specific module, student, course, school, section, or subject,
  administrators can easily filter and find what they need. MatHOTSanayan
  gives them many options to search, so they can manage exam results
  effectively and keep track of student progress.`,

  `In MatHOTSanayan, administrators can effortlessly create detailed Excel
  reports using the Advanced Filter feature. This feature helps them
  extract precise data based on their search criteria, ensuring that the
  Excel file contains exactly the information they need. This reports
  includes essential details such as student name, section, module title,
  module stage, score, remarks, and total time taken by students to finish
  a module.`,

  `To start generating a report, administrators first refine their dataset
  by conducting a search using the Advanced Filter feature. They can
  filter results by student names, sections, module titles, or any other
  relevant criteria. Once satisfied with the filtered dataset, they can
  export the data into an Excel file by clicking the “Download Excel”
  button.`,

  `The generated Excel report provides a comprehensive overview of student
  performance, allowing administrators to analyze key metrics such as
  scores and completion times. This valuable information can be utilized
  for various purposes, including academic assessments, performance
  evaluations, and progress tracking.`,

  `The Results Details section gives administrators a thorough look at
  students' exam performance, helping them understand what students are
  good at and where they need to improve. It starts by showing important
  information like the student's name, section, the module title
  corresponding to the examination taken, as well as whether they passed
  or failed. Administrators can also see how long it took students to
  finish the exam and get an idea of how much time they spent on each
  question.`,

  `In addition to qualitative insights, the Results Details section
  provides numbers that give a clear idea of how well students understand
  the subject. These numbers show their scores compared to the total
  number of questions, giving a measure of their skills. The percentage
  grade shows how well they did according to the grading system, helping
  administrators know if they met expectations.`,

  `Administrators can also see how engaged students were by looking at how
  many times they attempted each question. The accuracy score, which looks
  at the questions they answered correctly compared to how many they
  tried, along with the percentage grade, gives a good overall picture of
  performance, considering both accuracy and persistence. And by seeing
  how many questions students skipped, administrators can understand how
  they made decisions during the exam.`,

  `The third segment of the Results Details section presents a detailed
  table showing each question alongside the student's responses. This
  detailed view helps administrators go through responses one by one,
  identify recurring patterns, and understand how students solve problems.
  By looking closely at individual responses, administrators can figure
  out where students are strong and where they need help, making it easier
  to plan ways to improve their performance in future exams.`,

  `The Response Details section serves as a comprehensive tool for
  administrators to gauge how well students did on their exams. It
  provides a breakdown of each student's responses, making it easy to
  analyze and evaluate.`,

  `In the Response Category column, administrators can quickly see if
  students' answers were correct or incorrect. This helps them understand
  overall performance and find areas where students need to improve.`
