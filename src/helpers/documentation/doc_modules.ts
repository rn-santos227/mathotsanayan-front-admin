  `The Modules Manager Page in MatHotSanayan acts as a central hub,
  providing administrators with a robust set of tools to oversee and
  manage assessment modules efficiently. This pivotal control center
  streamlines essential tasks, offering a comprehensive suite of features
  for creating, updating, activating, and deleting modules. Administrators
  can effortlessly navigate through step-by-step procedures outlined in
  this documentation, ensuring a user-friendly experience in handling the
  intricacies of module management. From the inception of a new module to
  its eventual deactivation or deletion, every aspect is covered,
  empowering administrators with the control they need.`,

  `In addition to core module management functionalities, this
  documentation sheds light on the seamless integration of question
  management within the Modules Manager Page. This ensures a holistic
  approach to assessment administration, allowing administrators to not
  only structure modules but also add questions effortlessly. By providing
  detailed insights into the process of question addition, MatHotSanayan
  offers a comprehensive solution that enables administrators to tailor
  assessments to their specific needs. This dual functionality,
  encompassing both module and question management, establishes the
  Modules Manager Page as a versatile and indispensable tool within the
  MatHotSanayan ecosystem.`,

  `The Module Page Filter Search function in MatHotSanayan introduces a
  versatile and efficient way for administrators to pinpoint specific
  modules based on various criteria. This feature empowers users to
  streamline their workflow by searching for modules according to three
  key parameters: module name, subject name, or keywords within the
  module's description.`,

  `With the search by module name option, administrators can quickly locate
  a particular module by typing its name directly into the search bar.
  This targeted approach ensures swift access to specific assessments,
  saving valuable time and enhancing overall navigation.`,

  `Similarly, the search by subject name allows for the effortless
  categorization of modules. Administrators can filter modules based on
  their designated subject, facilitating a systematic organization that
  aligns with the educational institution's curriculum structure.`,

  `Moreover, the search by words within the module's description adds a
  layer of granularity to the search process. This functionality allows
  administrators to locate modules based on specific keywords present in
  their descriptions, providing a more nuanced and tailored approach to
  information retrieval.`,

  `Effortlessly initiate the creation of new assessment modules within
  MatHotSanayan by accessing the dedicated "Create Module" section. This
  intuitive process facilitates a seamless experience for administrators
  tasked with building robust assessments. Upon entering this section,
  administrators encounter a user-friendly interface featuring fields such
  as the module name, module step, passing grade, module description,
  module objective, and module instructions.`,

  `Begin the module creation process by specifying the module name, acting
  as the distinct title for the assessment. This field allows
  administrators to provide a clear and identifiable name, enhancing
  organization and clarity within the MatHotSanayan system.`,

  `As administrators enter module details, the module step field stands out
  as a unique and impactful element. This feature functions as a
  stage-setting tool, determining the accessibility of the module for
  students. If set to step 1, the module becomes immediately accessible to
  students. However, by adjusting the module step to 2 or higher,
  administrators can establish a sequential progression, allowing students
  to access the module only when they reach the designated stage.`,

  `Utilizing the passing grade slider, administrators have the flexibility
  to set the passing grade for the exam on a scale ranging from 10% to
  100%. This dynamic feature tailors assessments to meet the precise
  grading standards of the institution, offering adaptability in line with
  educational goals.`,

  `Furthermore, administrators can furnish additional information about the
  module through the module description, module objective, and module
  instruction fields. These details provide a comprehensive overview of
  the module's purpose, objectives, and specific instructions for both
  administrators and exam-takers.`,
