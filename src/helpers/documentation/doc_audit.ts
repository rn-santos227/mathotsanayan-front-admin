  `The Accounts Manager is a vital component of MatHOTSanayan. It is
  designed for overseeing user accounts, managing account information, and
  providing support to users regarding their accounts. It provides a
  comprehensive view of all registered accounts on the platform. This
  includes displaying account email addresses, account types (such as
  student or teacher), and respective account owner's names.`,

  `Every user account has a unique email address. This is used for logging
  in and communicating with the user. The Accounts Manager stores and
  manages these email addresses securely, ensuring they are accessible
  only to authorized personnel.`,

  `Each account's type is clearly indicated, distinguishing between
  students and teachers. This helps in streamlined management and tailored
  interactions based on user roles.`,

  `The account owner refers to the individual or entity that owns and
  operates the user account. For student accounts, the account owner is
  typically the student themselves, while for teacher accounts, it is the
  respective educator. Account ownership ensures accountability,
  personalized user experiences, and tailored access privileges.`,
