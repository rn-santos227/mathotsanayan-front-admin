  `The audit trail feature of MatHOTSanayan serves as a detailed
  record-keeper, documenting all activities and operations performed
  within the system, providing transparency, accountability, and security.
  It displays essential information, including the account name, activity,
  resource, and timestamp. The account name is the username associated
  with the individual performing the activity, helping to trace actions
  back to specific users.`,

  `Activities within the audit trail encompass a wide array of actions,
  ranging from user logins, creation of new students or teachers, updates
  to existing courses or schools, deletion of subjects, to the initiation
  or completion of examinations. This detailed information shows every
  user interaction with the system, providing invaluable insight into
  system usage and behavior.`,

  `Complementing the activity log is the resource field, which specifies
  the resource affected by the activity. Whether it involves users,
  modules, questions, courses, or other system components, this attribute
  adds depth to the audit trail, offering clarity on the scope and context
  of each activity within system interactions.`,

  `The inclusion of timestamps ensures precise tracking of when each
  activity occurred, establishing a chronological sequence of events. This
  chronological ordering facilitates seamless analysis and investigation,
  allowing administrators to swiftly identify anomalies, monitor system
  usage, and uphold the integrity of the platform.`,

  `The Filter Search feature on the Audit Trail Page in MatHOTSanayan
  allows administrators to narrow down and find specific information
  within an audit trail based on various criteria. It typically includes
  fields such as account name, activity, resources, and date.`,

  `With the search by account name option, administrators can just enter
  the username of a specific user or account. By doing so, administrators
  can filter the audit trail to show only actions performed by that
  particular individual.`,

  `Administrators can also specify the type of action they are interested
  in, such as login, update, creation, deletion, or any other activity
  tracked in the audit trail. This helps administrators focus on specific
  types of actions they want to review.`,

  `The resource field allows administrators to narrow down their search by
  specifying the resource affected by the activity. For example,
  administrators can filter by resources related to users, modules,
  questions, courses, or any other relevant system components.`,

  `Additionally, administrators can define a specific timeframe or date
  range to search within the audit trail. This allows them to focus on
  activities that occurred within a particular period, making it easier to
  track changes or incidents over time.`,

  `The Audit Details component of the Audit Trail serves as a comprehensive
  log that documents the specifics of every action taken within the system
  Here, the administrators uncover essential details such as the identity
  of the individual who performed the action, the IP address of the user,
  the activity undertaken, the resources affected, and audit content. This
  component holds immense significance as it provides a comprehensive
  overview of all activities, ensuring transparency, accountability, and
  security within the system.`,
