  `The audit trail feature of MatHOTSanayan serves as a detailed
  record-keeper, documenting all activities and operations performed
  within the system, providing transparency, accountability, and security.
  It displays essential information, including the account name, activity,
  resource, and timestamp. The account name is the username associated
  with the individual performing the activity, helping to trace actions
  back to specific users.`,

  `Activities within the audit trail encompass a wide array of actions,
  ranging from user logins, creation of new students or teachers, updates
  to existing courses or schools, deletion of subjects, to the initiation
  or completion of examinations. This detailed information shows every
  user interaction with the system, providing invaluable insight into
  system usage and behavior.`,

  `Complementing the activity log is the resource field, which specifies
  the resource affected by the activity. Whether it involves users,
  modules, questions, courses, or other system components, this attribute
  adds depth to the audit trail, offering clarity on the scope and context
  of each activity within system interactions.`,
