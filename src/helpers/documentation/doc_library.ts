  `The Accounts Manager is a vital component of MatHOTSanayan. It is
  designed for overseeing user accounts, managing account information, and
  providing support to users regarding their accounts. It provides a
  comprehensive view of all registered accounts on the platform. This
  includes displaying account email addresses, account types (such as
  student or teacher), and respective account owner's names.`,

  `Every user account has a unique email address. This is used for logging
  in and communicating with the user. The Accounts Manager stores and
  manages these email addresses securely, ensuring they are accessible
  only to authorized personnel.`,

  `Each account's type is clearly indicated, distinguishing between
  students and teachers. This helps in streamlined management and tailored
  interactions based on user roles.`,

  `The account owner refers to the individual or entity that owns and
  operates the user account. For student accounts, the account owner is
  typically the student themselves, while for teacher accounts, it is the
  respective educator. Account ownership ensures accountability,
  personalized user experiences, and tailored access privileges.`,

  `To facilitate efficient account management, the Accounts Manager
  features search options. Administrators can quickly locate specific
  accounts based on criteria like email address, account type, or account
  owner, streamlining tasks such as troubleshooting or account
  verification.`,

  `For enhanced security and user convenience, the Accounts Manager
  incorporates action button for resetting passwords. This functionality
  allows administrators to initiate the password reset process directly
  from the interface, enabling users to regain access to their accounts in
  case of forgotten or compromised passwords.`,

  `The Admin Manager in MatHOTSanayan is designed to oversee and manage
  administrative users and their contact numbers efficiently.`,

  `It displays the names of all administrative users registered on the
  platform. Each admin is identified by their name, which helps in
  recognizing and distinguishing between different administrators.
  Alongside the admin names, the Admin Manager lists the email addresses
  associated with each administrator. These email addresses serve as the
  primary means of communication and identification for administrative
  tasks and notifications. In addition to email addresses, the Admin
  Manager also includes contact numbers for each administrator. This
  allows for alternative means of communication and provides a way to
  reach administrators quickly for urgent matters or inquiries.`,

  `One of the key features of the Admin Manager is the ability to create
  new administrative accounts. This feature enables existing
  administrators to add new administrators to the administrative team,
  granting them access to platform management tools and functionalities
  and thereby distributing administrative tasks and responsibilities
  effectively.`,

  `Creating a new admin typically involves filling out a form or providing
  necessary details such as the new admin's name, email address, contact
  number, and a temporary password. Once created, the new admin can log in
  to the platform with their credentials and start performing
  administrative tasks as assigned`,
